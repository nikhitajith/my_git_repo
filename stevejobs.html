            <p class="edcon">In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon.
                He insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford.
                Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland,who was Reed's student body president at that time.
                Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed. He later asked her to come and
                live with him in a house he rented near the Reed campus, but she refused.After just one semester, Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents.
                Jobs later explained this was because he did not want to spend his parents' money on an education that seemed meaningless to him.
                He continued to attend by auditing his classes,including a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino.
                In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, Jobs stated that during this period,
                 he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly 
                 free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, Jobs said: 
                 "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, 
                 the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts</p>
        </div>
        <div  class="innovation">
            <h1 class="innovhead">DESIGN</h1>
            <p class="innovcon">Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism.
                In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey, and his sense of intuition 
                was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.He also learned from many references and sources,
                such as modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler, and the industrial designs of Richard Sapper and Dieter Rams.
               According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original
                design...".daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs,
                Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person." He is listed as either primary inventor or 
                co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer 
                and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, 
                sleeves, lanyards, and packages. His contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel of the product". 
                He and his industrial design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the patents.Most of these are design patents as
                opposed to utility patents or inventions; they are specific product designs such as both original and lamp-style iMacs, 
                and PowerBook G4 Titanium. He holds 43 issued US patents on inventions. The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with 
                "magnification" feature was issued the day before he died. Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and
                technical side of the original Apple computers, Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product 
                design.Involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time marketing executive and confidant Joanna Hoffman,
                known as one of the few employees at Apple and NeXT who could successfully stand up to Jobs while also engaging with him.
                Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed.
                 He despised the oxygen monitor on his finger, and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.Since his death, 
                 he has won 141 patents, more than most inventors during their lifetimes. He holds over 450 patents in total.</p>

                    <h5>Main article: Apple I</h5>
                    <p class="padding">Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer, which
                     led to the formation of Apple Computer in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I 
                     prototypes by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings. Eventually, 200 units were produced.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="padding">Apple II</h4>
                    <h5>Main article: Apple II series</h5>
                    <p class="padding"> Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer
                     products,[77] designed primarily by Wozniak while Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case[240]
                      and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.[75] It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by
                       Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="padding">Apple Lisa</h4>
                    <h5> article: Apple Lisa</h5>
                    <p class="padding">The Lisa is a personal computer developed by Apple from 1978 and sold in the early 1980s. It is the first personal
                    computer with a graphical user interface for business users.The Lisa sold poorly, at 100,000 units. 
                    In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project, he took over the Macintosh project, adding inspiration 
                    from Lisa. The final Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="padding"> Macintosh</h4>
                    <h5>Main article: Macintosh</h5>
                    <p class="padding">Once he joined the Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane 
                    accident and temporarily left the company.Jobs launched the Macintosh on January 24, 1984, as the first mass-market 
                    personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.This first model was later renamed to
                    Macintosh 128k among the prolific series. Since 1998, Apple has phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac",
                    though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since inception. The Macintosh was introduced by a 
                    US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984". It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on 
                    January 22, 1984, received as a "watershed event" and a "masterpiece".Regis McKenna called the ad "more 
                    successful than the Mac itself". It uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated 
                    by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) to save humanity from the conformity of IBM's 
                    domination of the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a 
                    dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother".</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="padding">iMac</h4>
                    <h5>Main article: iMac</h5>
                    <p class="padding">Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. 
                    Apple boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's".Described as "cartoonlike",
                    the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple 
                    introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining 
                    the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a 
                    "breathing" light effect when the computer went to sleep.The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. 
                    The iMac also featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB 
                    for connecting peripherals. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularized 
                    among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent 
                    plastic (to match the iMac design).</p>

                    <p class="padding">iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed
                    by Apple. It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available 
                    on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store 
                    is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.
                    Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, 
                    movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation 
                    onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App Store.</p>
                    
                   <h4 class="padding"> iPod</h4>

                    <p class="padding">The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size 
                    achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the 
                    first generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB. The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold 
                    before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry.
                    Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone.After the first few 
                    generations of iPod, Apple released the touchscreen iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the 
                    screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.</p>

                    <p class="padding">Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created 
                    such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it 
                    "Invention of the Year" for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of 
                    Communication.The completed iPhone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen 
                    smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and 
                    tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a 
                    faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller.The iPhone 4 was thinner than previous models, had a five 
                    megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary front-facing camera for video calls.
                    A major feature of the iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice 
                    recognition.</p>

            <h1 class="lifehead">LIFE</h1>
           <p class="lifecon"> Steven Jobs was born February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. 
            He grew up with one sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. Jobs remembers his father as being 
            very skilled at working with his hands.In 1961 the family moved to Mountain View, California. This area, just south of Palo 
            Alto, California, was becoming a center for electronics. Electronics form the basic elements of devices such as radios, 
            televisions, stereos, and computers. At that time people started to refer to the area as "Silicon Valley." This is because a
            substance called silicon is used in the manufacturing of electronic parts. As a child, Jobs preferred doing things by himself.
            He swam competitively, but was not interested in team sports or other group activities. He showed an early interest in 
            electronics and gadgetry. He spent a lot of time working in the garage workshop of a neighbor who worked at Hewlett-Packard, 
            an electronics manufacturer.Jobs also enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club. There he saw engineers demonstrate new 
            products, and he saw his first computer at the age of twelve. He was very impressed, and knew right away that he wanted to 
            work with computers.While in high school Jobs attended lectures at the Hewlett-Packard plant. On one occasion he boldly 
            asked William Hewlett (1931-2001), the president, for some parts he needed to complete a class project. Hewlett was so 
            impressed he gave Jobs the parts, and offered him a summer internship at Hewlett-Packard.</p>
